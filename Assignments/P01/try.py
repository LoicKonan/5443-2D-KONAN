'''
Show me a pygame gravity example.

This code creates a window with the size 700x500 and a ball with the starting position (50,50), a velocity of (0,0), 
and a radius of 20px. The ball's velocity will increase by a value of g = 0.1 every frame. The ball is drawn on the 
screen every frame using the draw.circle method.
